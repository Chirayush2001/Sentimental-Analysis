# Sentimental-Analysis
This project is based on NLP
In this project I have performed sentimental analysis on a text file(Total: 115 files)
Basically I had to access the excel file which had 115 rows, and the rows had URL's. I had to access all 115 rows(URL's) one by one which I did using for loop and extract the Title and Article info from the URL's.I used beautiful soup library to extract the info.
Then after extracting I had to store each article in a text file.
Then performed sentimental analysis on every text file using parameters such as Positive score,Negative score,Polarity score,Subjectivity score,average sentence length,average word length,complex words etc.
